Abstract
1. What is the project?
	This project is about making computer play thee Snake game. This is to be achieved by using the  reinforcement learning to train the computer to play. 

2. Overview, Goals
	In this project we will use reinforcement learning to train the computter program to play the snake game. We will learn the methods of MC ,TD and DP and will use it for sampling the environment according to some policy.we will use Q-learning to develop an optimal action selection policy. We will also learn about the neural networks and will implement it in some sort of statistical learning models for the snake game. By the end of our project our program will be able to learn and play the snake game.

3. why did you choose the project?
	We chose this project because we found the method of reinforcement and making the program learn according to the rewards and failure an interesting arena. It will  be a fun time for us making the computer play on its own according to its expirences. This would also be a very nice opportunity to learn machine learning and actually implementing it.......

4. Timeline

	week1: Learning basics of MC and TD...getting hands better on num py
	week2: Learning Q-learning and policy gradient for Q -Learning
		we will use the source http://burlap.cs.brown.edu/tutorials/cpl/ and study all 4 html files of this directory
		For policy gradient we may use follwing sources 
		http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/D.Silver/web/Teaching_files/pg.pdf
	week3: Studying neural nets and start impllementation on pong and get a brief idea of Deep learning
		for deep learning ::: http://icml.cc/2016/tutorials/deep_rl_tutorial.pdf
		for neural networks ::: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/artificial_intelligence/artificial_intelligence_neural_networks.htm
	week4: implementing on pong and testing it
	week5: start working on snake game
	week6:
